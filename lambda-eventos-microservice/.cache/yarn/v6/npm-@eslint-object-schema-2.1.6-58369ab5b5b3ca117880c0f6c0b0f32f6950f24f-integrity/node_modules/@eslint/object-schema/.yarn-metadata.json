    "readme": "# ObjectSchema Package\n\n## Overview\n\nA JavaScript object merge/validation utility where you can define a different merge and validation strategy for each key. This is helpful when you need to validate complex data structures and then merge them in a way that is more complex than `Object.assign()`. This is used in the [`@eslint/config-array`](https://npmjs.com/package/@eslint/config-array) package but can also be used on its own.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor Node.js and compatible runtimes:\n\n```shell\nnpm install @eslint/object-schema\n# or\nyarn add @eslint/object-schema\n# or\npnpm install @eslint/object-schema\n# or\nbun install @eslint/object-schema\n```\n\nFor Deno:\n\n```shell\ndeno add @eslint/object-schema\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nImport the `ObjectSchema` constructor:\n\n```js\n// using ESM\nimport { ObjectSchema } from \"@eslint/object-schema\";\n\n// using CommonJS\nconst { ObjectSchema } = require(\"@eslint/object-schema\");\n\nconst schema = new ObjectSchema({\n\t// define a definition for the \"downloads\" key\n\tdownloads: {\n\t\trequired: true,\n\t\tmerge(value1, value2) {\n\t\t\treturn value1 + value2;\n\t\t},\n\t\tvalidate(value) {\n\t\t\tif (typeof value !== \"number\") {\n\t\t\t\tthrow new Error(\"Expected downloads to be a number.\");\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\n\t// define a strategy for the \"versions\" key\n\tversion: {\n\t\trequired: true,\n\t\tmerge(value1, value2) {\n\t\t\treturn value1.concat(value2);\n\t\t},\n\t\tvalidate(value) {\n\t\t\tif (!Array.isArray(value)) {\n\t\t\t\tthrow new Error(\"Expected versions to be an array.\");\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t},\n});\n\nconst record1 = {\n\tdownloads: 25,\n\tversions: [\"v1.0.0\", \"v1.1.0\", \"v1.2.0\"],\n};\n\nconst record2 = {\n\tdownloads: 125,\n\tversions: [\"v2.0.0\", \"v2.1.0\", \"v3.0.0\"],\n};\n\n// make sure the records are valid\nschema.validate(record1);\nschema.validate(record2);\n\n// merge together (schema.merge() accepts any number of objects)\nconst result = schema.merge(record1, record2);\n\n// result looks like this:\n\nconst result = {\n\tdownloads: 75,\n\tversions: [\"v1.0.0\", \"v1.1.0\", \"v1.2.0\", \"v2.0.0\", \"v2.1.0\", \"v3.0.0\"],\n};\n```\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\n### Named merge strategies\n\nInstead of specifying a `merge()` method, you can specify one of the following strings to use a default merge strategy:\n\n- `\"assign\"` - use `Object.assign()` to merge the two values into one object.\n- `\"overwrite\"` - the second value always replaces the first.\n- `\"replace\"` - the second value replaces the first if the second is not `undefined`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nconst schema = new ObjectSchema({\n\tname: {\n\t\tmerge: \"replace\",\n\t\tvalidate() {},\n\t},\n});\n```\n\n### Named validation strategies\n\nInstead of specifying a `validate()` method, you can specify one of the following strings to use a default validation strategy:\n\n- `\"array\"` - value must be an array.\n- `\"boolean\"` - value must be a boolean.\n- `\"number\"` - value must be a number.\n- `\"object\"` - value must be an object.\n- `\"object?\"` - value must be an object or null.\n- `\"string\"` - value must be a string.\n- `\"string!\"` - value must be a non-empty string.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nconst schema = new ObjectSchema({\n\tname: {\n\t\tmerge: \"replace\",\n\t\tvalidate: \"string\",\n\t},\n});\n```\n\n### Subschemas\n\nIf you are defining a key that is, itself, an object, you can simplify the process by using a subschema. Instead of defining `merge()` and `validate()`, assign a `schema` key that contains a schema definition, like this:\n\n```js\nconst schema = new ObjectSchema({\n\tname: {\n\t\tschema: {\n\t\t\tfirst: {\n\t\t\t\tmerge: \"replace\",\n\t\t\t\tvalidate: \"string\",\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tlast: {\n\t\t\t\tmerge: \"replace\",\n\t\t\t\tvalidate: \"string\",\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t},\n});\n\nschema.validate({\n\tname: {\n\t\tfirst: \"n\",\n\t\tlast: \"z\",\n\t},\n});\n```\n\n### Remove Keys During Merge\n\nIf the merge strategy for a key returns `undefined`, then the key will not appear in the final object. For example:\n\n```js\nconst schema = new ObjectSchema({\n\tdate: {\n\t\tmerge() {\n\t\t\treturn undefined;\n\t\t},\n\t\tvalidate(value) {\n\t\t\tDate.parse(value); // throws an error when invalid\n\t\t},\n\t},\n});\n\nconst object1 = { date: \"5/5/2005\" };\nconst object2 = { date: \"6/6/2006\" };\n\nconst result = schema.merge(object1, object2);\n\nconsole.log(\"date\" in result); // false\n```\n\n### Requiring Another Key Be Present\n\nIf you'd like the presence of one key to require the presence of another key, you can use the `requires` property to specify an array of other properties that any key requires. For example:\n\n```js\nconst schema = new ObjectSchema();\n\nconst schema = new ObjectSchema({\n\tdate: {\n\t\tmerge() {\n\t\t\treturn undefined;\n\t\t},\n\t\tvalidate(value) {\n\t\t\tDate.parse(value); // throws an error when invalid\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\ttime: {\n\t\trequires: [\"date\"],\n\t\tmerge(first, second) {\n\t\t\treturn second;\n\t\t},\n\t\tvalidate(value) {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t},\n\t},\n});\n\n// throws error: Key \"time\" requires keys \"date\"\nschema.validate({\n\ttime: \"13:45\",\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, even though `date` is an optional key, it is required to be present whenever `time` is present.\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0\n\n<!-- NOTE: This section is autogenerated.
