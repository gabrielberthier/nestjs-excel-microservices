    "readme": "# Buffer for Array\n\nBuffer for Array (B4A) provides a set of functions for bridging the gap between the Node.js `Buffer` class and the `Uint8Array` class. A browser compatibility layer is also included, making it possible to use B4A in both Node.js and browsers without having to worry about whether you're dealing with buffers or typed arrays.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install b4a\n```\n\n## API\n\n#### `b4a.isBuffer(value)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferisbufferobj\n\nThis will also return `true` when passed a `Uint8Array`.\n\n#### `b4a.isEncoding(encoding)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferisencodingencoding\n\n#### `b4a.alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferallocsize-fill-encoding\n\n#### `b4a.allocUnsafe(size)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferallocunsafesize\n\n#### `b4a.allocUnsafeSlow(size)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferallocunsafeslowsize\n\n#### `b4a.byteLength(string)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferbytelengthstring-encoding\n\n#### `b4a.compare(buf1, buf2)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-buffercomparebuf1-buf2\n\n#### `b4a.concat(buffers[, totalLength])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferconcatlist-totallength\n\n#### `b4a.copy(source, target[, targetStart[, sourceStart[, sourceEnd]]])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufcopytarget-targetstart-sourcestart-sourceend\n\n#### `b4a.equals(buf1, buf2)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufequalsotherbuffer\n\n#### `b4a.fill(buffer, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffillvalue-offset-end-encoding\n\n#### `b4a.from(array)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferfromarray\n\n#### `b4a.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferfromarraybuffer-byteoffset-length\n\n#### `b4a.from(buffer)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferfrombuffer\n\n#### `b4a.from(string[, encoding])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferfromstring-encoding\n\n#### `b4a.includes(buffer, value[, byteOffset][, encoding])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufincludesvalue-byteoffset-encoding\n\n#### `b4a.indexOf(buffer, value[, byteOffset][, encoding])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufindexofvalue-byteoffset-encoding\n\n#### `b4a.lastIndexOf(buffer, value[, byteOffset][, encoding])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buflastindexofvalue-byteoffset-encoding\n\n#### `b4a.swap16(buffer)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufswap16\n\n#### `b4a.swap32(buffer)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufswap32\n\n#### `b4a.swap64(buffer)`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufswap64\n\n#### `b4a.toBuffer(buffer)`\n\nConvert a buffer to its canonical representation. In Node.js, the canonical representation is a `Buffer`. In the browser, the canonical representation is a `Uint8Array`.\n\n#### `b4a.toString(buffer, [encoding[, start[, end]]])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buftostringencoding-start-end\n\n#### `b4a.write(buffer, string[, offset[, length]][, encoding])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufwritestring-offset-length-encoding\n\n#### `b4a.writeDoubleLE(buffer, value[, offset])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufwritedoublelevalue-offset\n\n#### `b4a.writeFloatLE(buffer, value[, offset])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufwritefloatlevalue-offset\n\n#### `b4a.writeUInt32LE(buffer, value[, offset])`\n\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufwriteuint32levalue-offset\n\n#### `b4a.writeInt32LE(buffer, value[, offset])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufwriteint32levalue-offset\n\n#### `b4a.readDoubleLE(buffer[, offset])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufreaddoubleleoffset\n\n#### `b4a.readFloatLE(buffer[, offset])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufreadfloatleoffset\n\n#### `b4a.readUInt32LE(buffer[, offset])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufreaduint32leoffset\n\n#### `b4a.readInt32LE(buffer[, offset])`\n\nSee https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufreadint32leoffset\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0\n",
